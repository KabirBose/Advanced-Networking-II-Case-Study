# Advanced Networking II Case Study

A lab case study that I completed in my Advanced Networking II class that applies my knowledge of the CCNA and CCNP to configure a network based on a topology.

# Setup

I cannot post the topology as it would go against the guidelines of my university, however this network can be configured with the following:
1. Cisco IOS
2. Eve-NG, GNS3, or Cisco CML

*Some features will not be supported by Cisco Packet Tracer*

# Usage

1. Open your network simulation tool
2. Create the devices listed based on the Cisco configurations in this repository
3. Test out your small homelab network
